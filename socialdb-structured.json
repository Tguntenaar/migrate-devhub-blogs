Today we are happy to announce the launch of the Developer Governance staking pool, [neardevgov.poolv1.near](https://wallet.near.org/staking/neardevgov.poolv1.near) that you can use to directly support the NEAR developer ecosystem.\n\nSo far Developer Governance has kicked off 4 Work Groups and 11 Community Groups that all have regular meetings to discuss new ideas and formally agree on technical decisions. Our next steps are to scale what we’ve been already doing, introduce a platform for matching ideas with sponsorships and people implementing them, and further diversify community participation.\n\nThis project exists to help organize the NEAR developer ecosystem, and to a lesser extent to be an asset distribution router. However, to scale further, meet the above-mentioned growth milestones, and to simply cover the operational costs, we need to start receiving sponsorship and funding.\n\nIn the spirit of this being a community-centric project we would like to invite everyone to support Developer Governance DAO financially by staking NEAR tokens with our staking pool. All staking fees will be spent on the operation of the Developer Governance, which will include operational costs (including node/website infra costs and legal fees), incentivisation of the community in some select cases, direct grants to the projects, among other things. All transactions will be going through [neardevgov.sputnik-dao.near](https://app.astrodao.com/dao/neardevgov.sputnik-dao.near) which allows full transparency and accountability into asset allocation.",

          "": "A few months ago, we launched the NEAR Developer Governance to help decentralize the NEAR developer ecosystem. The goal is to encourage broad innovation from the developer community without relying on a single entity. This opens the door for anyone to participate and contribute in any capacity in a transparent and permissionless way, while ensuring quality.\n\nThere are many ways to engage with developer governance. Almost any type of developer community activity falls under one of four categories:\n\n![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreihdce75h4zzarrorgazcoh6wjb4qyoy65d5x7ymqvvc2xtdqknuwi)\n\n*For example, Alice starts with an idea and bounces her thoughts in some community channel about it. This group gives her social validation and helps hone her idea, enough for her to start planning implementation. At some point she might choose to validate her plan with subject matter experts, to ensure other products agree to integrate with her tech, to rally more community behind it, to seek funding, or to simply strengthen her pitch. One of the acceleration and funding programs passes by and decides to fund and enable her project based on her strong plan and community support.*\n\nThis simple story does not describe all the options available to Alice. If she has a solution already fully figured out in her mind, she might choose to implement it without announcing it or seeking validation, or to fundraise entirely on her own. Also, her idea might not have anything to do with writing code. Perhaps she is offering to review or audit someone else’s project, or to organize a technical event, etc. Regardless of what she chooses to do and not do, there are four categories of developer community activity she can choose to engage with.\n\nDeveloper Governance is both a decentralized social structure and a set of tools. As a social structure it consists of groups and roles with different responsibilities that are aligned with each of the four categories below. And for each of the categories there are tools that a person can use to Ideate, Implement, Review, or Support.\n\n## Ideate\nAny improvement to the NEAR ecosystem starts with an idea. We want to provide a place for people to freely express and explore their ideas in a supportive and encouraging environment. It should be done in the most permissionless and low-barrier way. But people cannot be just thrusted into general purpose chats where their ideas are buried in the noise and where it is hard to discover like-minded people. Based on our experience in other Open Source communities, we adopted the concept of a Community Group (CG) – a self-organized circle of people interested in a specific topic. CGs are not controlled by anyone but the people organizing them and anyone can create a CG with the specialization they want.\n\n**Ways to participate in ideation:**\n\nSubmit your idea on the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed)\n- Join an existing [Community Group ](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=communities) and discuss ideas\n- Start a new [Community Group ](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=communities)\n\n## Implement\nCoding is the defining feature of the development community, and we don’t want to create any barriers in the way of community members who just want to write some code. We recognize that sometimes coding is done in response to some idea and that people can discover ideas as the result of coding. However, we want the coding to be inclusive and therefore if you want to submit your implementation specification, you first need to describe an idea even if it is vague. In this way, anyone can propose alternative implementations to your idea.\n\n**Ways to participate in implementation:**\n\n- Explore existing Ideas on the  [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed) and submit implementation proposals\n- Propose an original idea and submit implementation details on the  [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed)\n- Comment on the existing submissions and discuss their technical details\n\n## Review\n* While you can discuss your idea or solution with the general community, the social support in itself is frequently insufficient if you need to be integrated across the ecosystem, included into some standards or the protocol, and if you are seeking funding or other support. To validate your idea more officially,  you need a recognized group of experts to review and approve it. Following the example of [Rust governance](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance), we adopted the concept of a Work Group (WG) – a selected committee of subject matter experts that make official decisions on certain questions. Work Groups follow a rigorous [NEP-0001](https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/neps/nep-0001.md) process which guarantees that proposals are reviewed fairly and timely.\n\nWe do not limit reviews to Work Groups only. If you are a valuable and recognized expert (e.g. a security auditor), you might post your review to someone’s submission for free or at a cost. Anyone can submit a review as an attestation to an existing submission, but keep in mind that your reputation is on the line. Consider just leaving a comment, if unsure.\n\n**Ways to participate in reviews:**\n\n- Request a review to your idea on the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed) by leaving a comment and tagging it with a corresponding label, e.g. “wg-protocol”\n- Become a WG member by actively participating in CG (other WG members will notice and nominate you)\n- If you are a recognized expert post or suggest doing attestations on the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed)\n\n## Support \n[NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed) is a platform that enables organizations seeking to fund and help NEAR ecosystem projects. NEAR Foundation, NDC, and various accelerators have different criteria and motivation to sponsor and support ecosystem projects. However, they don’t have resources to review all applications and oversee proper utilization of funds. While we don’t want our developer community to be centered around funding, we want to make funding as easy as possible.\n\nSponsors can quickly explore projects matching their criteria by using filtering with labels (coming soon) and checking out the attestations submitted by the experts, e.g. Work Groups. They can also request reviews from WG in the comments of the ideas and submissions. Once they find projects that are matching their criteria, they can negotiate the cost in the comments or delegate it to the Work Group experts. Finally, they can submit a sponsorship with and designate an expert to supervise funds utilization, which might require paying them a fee. is a platform that enables organizations seeking to fund and help NEAR ecosystem projects.

          "": "*The previous blog [post](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=2028) covered various ways to participate on DevHub. This post dives further into the ideation area.*\n\nThe first step in any NEAR ecosystem project is ideation. It is crucial to have a way to find people to share and explore ideas with, partly because it can save a lot of time based on prior discussions. But also because it can help strengthen your ideas & gauge support from a diversity of stakeholders.\n\nHere are three ways to get started:\n\n## 1. Sharing ideas on the NEAR Dev Hub\nThe best place to share an idea is in the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed). Anyone can add an idea in any shape or form. The more your idea is fleshed out, the higher chances it will receive votes and comments. By posting an idea, you are inviting others to comment or propose their solutions. It is critical to specify what sort of response you are hoping for.\n\nHow to share an idea:\n\n**1) Check for prior ideas:** Before posting your idea, please search the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed) for similar ideas to learn from previous efforts. If you find a similar idea, consider how your proposed idea differs from or builds upon the existing one. If you already have a solution in mind, consider responding with a Solution Post to an existing idea.\n\n**2) Create a post:** In the [proposal feed](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed), Click Create Idea and fill out all the fields.\n\n- Posting guidelines:\n• Labels – The appropriate label categories\n• Title –  A short summary of the proposed idea\n• Description – The relevant information and rationale to enable the community to provide feedback. Describe the problem or opportunity your idea is addressing, as well as your desired outcome. It is also helpful to include a clear call to action for community members, such as asking for feedback on how to improve certain aspects of the idea.\n\n\n**3) Share with the ecosystem:** Once posted, the author is responsible for gathering social support or expert validation. Consider reaching out to any relevant Community Groups or individuals and leading the discussion further.\n\n\n**4) Iterate:** Monitor your post for any replies and take the time to follow up with people who provided feedback. If you are ready to move from idea to implementation, consider submitting a Solution Post to your idea or encouraging others to do so.\n\nExample Post:\n![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreifjcyk2cj64aol2uh5pb76brytv3affg335rzczj3tzgkyhuulbtq)\n\n## 2. Exploring ideas using existing community groups\nIf you have an early seed for an idea, or a topic area you are interested in exploring, consider joining an existing developer Community Group (CG). CGs are self-organized groups of people interested in a specific topic, such as Zero Knowledge or Wallet Standards. They are not controlled by anyone but the people organizing them. They offer a great opportunity to meet and discuss ideas with like-minded people. Most groups have a dedicated social channel, like Telegram, as well as regular  video calls or in-person events.\n\n\n\n**How to engage with an existing group:**\n\n- Search for groups: Browse the list of existing [Community Groups](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=communities) to familiarize yourself with their topic area, guidelines, and communication channels.\n\n- Get involved: Join the CG’s dedicated social channel and learn about their recent activities. Don’t forget to introduce yourself.\n\n- Join events: Review previous meeting notes/recordings and register for upcoming meetings. In the future, consider volunteering to speak about a topic or even to lead the meeting.\n\n- Participate in discussions: Comment on existing ideas or discussions. Or propose a new idea.\n\nExample ideas:\n- A vague wish: “I think it would be great if NEAR supported ZK contracts”\n- A highly detailed multi-page specification: A  new consensus algorithm\n- A concern: “near-api-js does not use TypeScript everywhere and it is kinda concerning to me”\n- A stackoverflow problem: “I cannot figure out how to make Markdown work in near.social”\n\n## 3. Starting a new community group\nIf none of the existing CGs work for you, consider [creating your own CG](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=communities)!\n\nFor more insights and to stay up to date on our latest updates, sign up for our newsletter below or follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NEARDevGov) and [Telegram](https://t.me/NEARDevGov).",

We provide social structures and tools to empower anyone to ideate, implement, review, and support projects in the NEAR ecosystem.\n\n### Mission\nBuild a growing self-sufficient community of NEAR developers to enable a thriving NEAR ecosystem.\n\n### Values\n- **Decentralized:** We are building together.\n- **Transparent:** All decision making and communication is open.\n- **Self-sufficient:** We do not critically depend on any single entity.\n- **Robust:** Any role or team can be duplicated or replaced.\n- **High-velocity:** We need to move faster than classic OSS.\n\n### Vision\nWe are building an open source developer community on NEAR that owns all aspects of its own success, including coding, event organization, promotion, fundraising, partnerships, etc. DevDAO establishes and maintains the structure and the processes to grow our developer ecosystem.\n\nExample areas of involvement include:\n\n- **Technical decision making:** Partnering with recognized experts to review technical proposals and making decisions based on the needs of the community and ecosystem.\n- **Creating deep tech awareness:** Working with marketing partners to create awareness on interesting projects and technology areas.\n- **Organizing events and local presence:** Organizing events and empowering community leaders with resources to grow their local communities.\n- **Managing documentation and public repositories:** Managing a variety of documentation and public repositories that support NEAR developers.\n\n### Roles & Responsibilities\nDevDAO provides various social structures to support developers:\n\n- **Work Groups:** A formal committee of selected subject matter experts who make official decisions on proposals and questions in their ecosystem focus area. Each work group has the authority to review proposals using a strict process, suggest funding to a DAO, and hold grant recipients accountable. They also engage with the community to understand their needs and encourage ideation. As of April 2023, we have six Work Groups with more underway. There is also a Moderators Work Group that supervises and facilitates other Work Groups.\n- **Community Groups:** An informal self-organized group of people interested in a specific topic area. While this group does not make official decisions, it offers a great opportunity to connect with others to share ideas and submit proposals. Each group is not controlled by anyone but the people who are organizing it. We have about 15 Community Groups as of April 2023.\n- **DevDAO Operations:** A minimal group of operators managing the legal and the administrative side of DevDAO.\n\n### Sponsorships\nOur goal is to grow an ecosystem of developers who are here because they like the technology and community. Given that there’s a lot of time and effort that goes into this, we have financial means to compensate for some activities and projects for the involvement areas above. Our budget comes from our [staking pool](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=2015), the NEAR Foundation, as well as other partners in the ecosystem.\n\nWe use the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=home) as our main platform for sponsoring projects and individual contributions to the NEAR developer ecosystem. The [Funding Board](https://near.social/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Boards?selectedBoardId=funding) shows all the projects that we approved for funding.\n\nIf you are interested in applying for funding from DevDAO, check out our [funding guidelines](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=2036).",

          "": "# Introduction\nThe journey of any project within DevHub and the NEAR ecosystem generally starts with the seed of ideation. Harnessing the power to share, explore, and expand upon your ideas with others is not merely beneficial. It's essential. This process is a starting point that builds on prior discussions, saving you time while concurrently enriching your concept with diverse perspectives. Moreover, it's a robust method to assess support from a spectrum of stakeholders. \n\n### The Ideation Process 💡\nBefore you dive into the funding aspect of your collaboration with DevHub, we strongly recommend familiarizing yourself with this ideation process. If you need help figuring out where to begin, we've covered you with this insightful post: [How to Ideate on DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=2029). \n\nIf you have already nurtured and refined your idea, you're ready to draft and post your funding proposal. We understand that this might seem daunting. But remember, this is your chance to transform your idea into reality and showcase its value and potential to the world. This guide is here to help you craft a compelling, convincing, and concise proposal that will capture the interest of potential funders. Let's embark on this journey together, turning your secret into a shared vision that others are enthusiastic about investing in.\n\n### Posting on DevHub 📝\nBefore you start writing your proposal, visit our [forum](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed). Spend some time exploring existing proposals and ideas. This will help you understand the format and style of successful proposals and ascertain if your idea aligns with the typically funded projects. Once you are ready to post, press the \"Post\" button at the top of the feed.\n\n![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreie5vmzqkcopiythranbzusjnky6p6jiv7mvsk7vetas726c2j77mu)\n\nNow you should see a form. This is your proposal's primary source of truth, so let’s look so you understand what we expect to see there.\n\n### Understanding Markdown 👨💻\n\nAs you begin crafting your proposal, it's important to note that our forum requires submissions to be formatted using Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax designed for formatting text on the web. It allows you to control the display of the document by adding simple symbols and characters to your text. \n\nWith Markdown, you can create headings, bold or \"italic\" text, add links, insert images, and more.\n\nFor example, to make a text bold in Markdown, you would wrap the text in two asterisks , and for a link, you would put the text of the link in brackets and the URL in parentheses.\n\nIf you're new to Markdown or need a refresher, don't worry. Many great resources are available online to help you understand and effectively use them. This [comprehensive guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) is a fantastic starting point for beginners. It walks you through the basics and gets progressively more detailed, allowing you to master Markdown at your own pace. \n\nRemember, the goal of using Markdown is to make your proposal clear, readable, and well-presented. Spend a little time familiarizing yourself with Markdown, it will significantly affect how your submission is received.\n\n### Filling out the form ✍️\n##### What do you want to create?\nIf you are looking for funding, first select \"Solution.\" \n\n##### Title:\nCreate an engaging and concise title that encapsulates your proposal. This should grab the attention of potential funders and make them want to know more.\n\n\n##### Description: \nThis is the most crucial part of the proposal because it should contain all the information regarding the proposal, including timelines, milestones, costs, etc. \n\n- Begin your proposal with an introduction briefly overviewing your project. Describe the project's objectives, your team, and why you're passionate about it.\n\n- Now, it's important to add a comprehensive \"Summary of Activities.\" This is where you outline all the activities you intend to carry out during your project's duration. Where appropriate, categorize these activities into distinct sections. Each activity should have an associated timeframe, clearly indicating its estimated duration. This summary isn't merely a formality—it serves a vital purpose in allowing the community to follow the progress of your proposal. Remember to use markdown to create all sections, links, etc.\n\nWhether you're a first-time poster or a regular forum participant, or even if this proposal builds on previous ones, remember to include links to related past proposals. These links provide crucial context and history for your current project.\n\nThis section also serves as a resource hub for your proposal. It's the ideal spot to include any additional material that may strengthen your proposal's case: links to external resources, relevant documentation, explanatory videos, etc. All these materials can enrich your proposal and aid in the review process, making it easier to understand and evaluate your project.\n\n- Specify a timeline so your proposal's start and end dates are precise. This allows funders to understand the timeline for your project and when they can expect to see results.\n\n- Finally, you must specify the particularities of the funding you are requesting and your **justification** (see [factors](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=2036) to consider). Are you calculating the amount on an hourly basis? If so, how many hours a week, day, or month? What is the hourly or daily rate? Is it milestone based? What part of the funding corresponds to each milestone?\n\n##### Labels:\nThis is an optional field that can be left empty, but we encourage you to include any community labels that fit the nature of the proposal. For more information about DevHub communities, you can look [here](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=communities).\n\n![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreicihpp65a2ln3e73pklz5mmtif6dcks2obhpk43od3ox3gd554hpu)\n\n##### Are you seeking funding for your solution? \nIf you are looking for funding, select \"Yes\".\n\n![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreifswtxsckyxdbfhigtygujxxsi2mg2pil5rm74kgfoaz3ovqmo5le)\n\n##### Currency:\n\n\nThis is the nomination of the payment, not necessarily how you will be paid. You have three options here. NEAR, USDC, USDT, but please select a USD based currency for ease of assessing your proposal.\n\n![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreido7l3c5byiehc223tcqvswle5vxbgz7bdi4fjfzfthix5sf2hf44)\n\n##### Requested amount:\nHere, ***using numbers only,*** specify the amount you want.\n\n![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreid4f6mqybigrqy3hz6azh56jqcqyd6c37xmas3fv5k2udk2jrrucm)\n\n\n##### Requested sponsor:\n\nIf you specifically request funding from DevHub, you can enter @neardevgov.near. However, you can add any other sponsor, especially if you have already engaged with them.\n\n![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreieodsm2s5i674jgzidtdnxanveu6lbuikrdktanrpvsq3mgehpm6q)\n\nNow, you are ready to submit. But before, we suggest you read your proposal before posting to ensure no errors or omissions. Have a team member or mentor review it too. Once you're satisfied with how your proposal looks, hit 'Submit.' and Congratulations! you've posted your funding proposal.\n\n#### What Happens Next? 🙇\nNow that your proposal has been posted, a few things must happen before you get funded.\n\n- **Amplify:** The appropriate team or community may give feedback to support or reject your proposal. The author’s responsible for getting social support or requesting expert validation. Consider reaching out to any relevant community groups or individuals. Also, stay active on the forum and respond to any questions or feedback from potential funders. This engagement will show your commitment and may increase your chances of securing funding. \n\n- **Approval:** If a sponsor such as DevHub decides to approve the proposal, they will reply with a sponsorship post and provide more details about the next steps, such as the KYC process and how to proceed with the payment.\n\n#### What if my proposal is rejected? 😯\nEven with the best preparation and utmost clarity, there may be instances when a proposal gets rejected. If you find yourself in this situation, we urge you not to be discouraged. Remember, each rejection is an opportunity for learning and improvement. Take the time to understand the feedback provided, evaluate your proposal, and identify areas that can be strengthened.\n\nUse this setback as fuel to refine your proposal and make it more compelling. Engage with the community, ask questions, seek advice, and don't hesitate to iterate on your ideas. A proposal rejection is not a judgment on your idea's worth or potential but rather an invitation to look at it from a different perspective and make it even more robust.\n\nSo if your proposal doesn't get approved on the first try, take a deep breath and prepare to dive back in. Remember, every successful innovator has faced rejection, and your determination and resilience will ultimately turn your vision into a reality. We look forward to your revised proposal and applaud your courage and persistence in bringing your idea to life.\n\n#### Decentralizing success 🌟\nPosting your funding proposal on our DevHub forum is a systematic process that, when carefully followed, can significantly increase your chances of gaining the support and backing you need. Clarity, completeness, and enthusiasm are integral to a successful proposal, so this guide has provided a detailed roadmap from drafting and submitting your proposal and navigating the review and approval process. \n\n‍\n\nFinally, remember that a rejected proposal is not the end of the road. Instead, it's an opportunity for growth and refinement. Don't retreat in the face of failure—welcome it, learn from it, and leverage it as your catalyst to bounce back stronger. \n\n‍\n\nYour tenacity and resilience will ultimately be the driving force behind your vision turning into reality. Let these components radiate through your write-up. Now, step forward and give voice to your idea, and remember, the DevHub community is rooting for you, and here's wishing you the best of luck! 🚀",

          "": "Are you or your team working on a NEAR ecosystem common good project and looking for funding? In this post, we will take a closer look at who determines the funding at DevHub, what factors to consider when proposing the funding amount, and how to submit a funding request.\n\nNEAR DevHub plays a major role in facilitating technical projects and empowering anyone to [contribute to the ecosystem](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=2028). A big part of this is providing financial support to some of the activities that go into bringing innovative projects to life.\n\n### Who determines the funding\nThe funding amount for a proposal is a collaborative and transparent effort between the applicant, the Work Groups, and the Developer DAO moderators.\n\nIt starts with the applicant figuring out the appropriate amount to ask for in their proposal based on factors such as project complexity, timeline, and skill levels. Once the applicant posts their proposal on the [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed), various Work Groups evaluate the technical and product aspects of the proposal within their area of expertise. They also assess the project cost considerations, and in some cases negotiate with the applicant. Since Work Groups specialize in different areas, their evaluation may vary. After the Work Groups provide their attestations, the Developer DAO moderators will consolidate the feedback and make the final funding decision. In some cases, the Developer DAO moderators may schedule a public call to meet with the applicant(s) to discuss or negotiate the proposal.\n\n### What factors to consider when determining the funding\nAll parties mentioned above should use the following factors when determining the funding amount.\n\n- Project complexity and duration: Consider the level of effort and the length of the project.\n- Seniority and skill required for the task. Consider using [Levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/) as a guideline to determine the expected hourly rate for each level of seniority and role.\n- Temporary nature of the engagement: Adjust for the temporary nature of engagement. Since temporary engagements are less financially secure than full-time job positions, an extra 20-80% markup is potentially justifiable.\n- Special skills or experience: If the project requires niche skills, such as a proven knowledge of NEAR protocol internals, a person with such skills can justify requesting more compensation.\n- Economic circumstances: While it is difficult to apply geographic compensation calibration consistently in a blockchain space, it is also unfair to recognize that some teams might have a 4x lower cost of the workforce than other teams due to their geographic location. We expect applicants to be open about it and for Work Groups to enforce [geographic coefficients](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721125654/https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/calculator/) when the disparity is drastic.\n- Diversification of the NEAR ecosystem: It is in the interests of DevHub to support multiple entities with funding, rather than giving all grants to a single qualified party. Therefore, in some rare cases, funding may be granted to a party that is slightly less fit but is a newcomer to the ecosystem.\n\n### Submitting funding requests on the NEAR Dev Hub\nThe best place to submit a funding request is through a solution post on [NEAR DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=feed). You must first create an [idea](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=2029) post, and reply to it with a solution post type.\n\nFunding requests guidelines:\n\n- Project details: Include a clear overview of the project goals, scope, deliverables, and timeline.\n- Budget breakdown: To ensure transparency and increase the chances of approval, the applicant should include a budget breakdown with justification based on the various factors mentioned in the previous section.\n- Timeline: Projects and their corresponding funding should have a short timeline, preferably under a month. This helps ensure project success by creating a clearly defined scope and minimizing risks. If a project has multiple milestones, propose each milestone as an independent funding request.\n- Evaluation before funding: The bulk of the evaluation should happen before the project receives the funding. This helps to minimize the risks and ensure the project meets the desired goals.",

          "": "\nWe're thrilled to introduce the launch of DevHub’s new brand identity and platform revamp, all aimed at strengthening the decentralized NEAR developer ecosystem. Our revamped platform is tailored to enhance your exploration of the NEAR ecosystem, foster connections with like-minded individuals, and provide the support you need to turn your ideas into reality. Welcome to the renewed DevHub, ***the decentralized home base for NEAR builders.***\n\n### What’s new?\n\n\n**New Branding**\nOur [new brand identity](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/4/folders/1C0GMmGq3MzbVPpxvf9807IU-7kpc2_v5) carries a sense of familiarity for developers, drawing inspiration from Unix systems where the \"/dev\" directory is ever-present as the root. Now, DevHub becomes your home directory—a base for builders in the NEAR ecosystem. We've also kept a visual connection with NEAR through our choice of colours and design elements while allowing flexibility to accommodate a range of user-generated content. \n\n**Revamped Platform**\nWe’ve given the [DevHub platform](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=feed) a sleek makeover that mirrors our new brand. Right from your first visit, you'll notice a more user-friendly experience featuring updated colours, a fresh logo, and improved navigation. Whether you're exploring communities, seeking opportunities to get involved, or accessing support, our platform is your trusty guide.\n\n**Improved Homepage**\nTo make DevHub even more welcoming, we've separated the activity feed and introduced a [new landing page](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=home). The homepage now provides newcomers and seasoned NEAR developers with essential information about NEAR's technical merits. It also showcases our vibrant communities and provides a clear path for everyone to get involved, whether you want to propose new ideas, host events, or mentor developers. We've also created a support section that aggregates important resources for builders to bring their ideas to reality.\n\n**Community Widgets & Blog**\nWe introduced a new widget framework, designed to offer more customization options for communities. Now you can add and configure multiple tabs, such as Wikis, GitHub boards, and telegram integration. The new blog widget enables communities to share news and updates easily, while the new blog page on DevHub curates a collection of helpful resources to empower the DevHub community.\n\n**Performance Improvements & Mobile Support**\nLastly, DevHub has undergone comprehensive refactoring to boost load times, refine search functionality, and ensure full mobile support. With these improvements, you can access DevHub anytime, anywhere, and enjoy a smoother experience navigating the NEAR developer ecosystem.\n\nIn the coming weeks and months, you can expect to see more exciting changes to the DevHub platform. These changes are not just aesthetic, they’re also about amplifying our commitment to the community of NEAR builders and enabling seamless collaboration. Our mission remains unchanged: to foster a productive and innovative ecosystem of open-source developers on NEAR who are deeply committed to the common good. \n\nJoin us on this journey to shape the future of the Open Web together!\n\n\n",

          "": "# Introduction\n\nBuilding Ethereum dApps on the BOS Network involves interacting with your Ethereum wallet and smart contracts. BOS allows you to connect the Ether.js library (Ethereum API) within its virtual machine (VM), enabling seamless interaction with smart contracts and your MetaMask wallet. This quick guide will walk you through the essential steps.\n\n### **Step 1: Getting the Contract Address**\n\nThe first step is to identify the smart contract you want to interact with. Most projects, like Gains Network on the BOS or Uniswap, provide a website with links to their contract addresses. Once you have the contract address in mind, you'll need to obtain the ABI (Application Binary Interface) for the contract. The ABI defines the functions that you can call on the contract, and it can usually be found on Etherscan.\n\n### **Step 2: Establishing Wallet Connectivity**\n\nTo interact, you need to connect your wallet because it is used to make RPC calls. BOS provides a widget known as `\"web3 connect\"` to handle wallet connections. This component seamlessly integrates with MetaMask. When you click on it, it opens up your MetaMask, prompting you to grant permission to connect your wallet.\n\n\n```\n<Web3Connect\n          className=\"CssClassName\"\n           connectLabel=\"ButtonLabel\"\n     />\n  )}\n```\n\nOnce the connection is successful you have access to the connected account, you can make contract calls with your existing deployed contract using your existing contract address (Address that was used to deploy your contract) and ABI (Application Binary Interface). \n\n**Note**: This means you must have deployed your App and you actually have an ABI before trying to make such contract calls.\n\n\n### **Step 3: Setting up the Contract Interface**\n\nNow you need to call the contract, so you have to convert the ABI into a proper interface by calling an ethers function and then passing in that ABI to the function. To convert the ABI into a usable interface, you can use the following code:\n\n```\nconst iface = new ethers.utils.Interface(stakingAbi.body);\n```\n\nThis code transforms the ABI into a proper interface. With this interface, you can call functions from the contract with ease. For example:\n\n```\nconst getTokenBalance = (receiver) => {\n  const encodedData = tokenIFace.encodeFunctionData(\"balanceOf\", [receiver]);\n```\n\nBasically you call the interface you converted, then you do `.encodefunctiondata` which means you're trying to encode the function that we are trying to call. Then you pass in the name of the function which is `balanceOf` , and if the function takes a parameter, you pass in an \"array\".\n\n### **Step 4: Interacting with the Contract**\n\n```\nconst getRewardBalance = () => {\n  const encodedData = iface.encodeFunctionData(\"accDaiPerToken\");\n  return Ethers.provider()\n    .call({\n      to: gainsStakingContract,\n      data: encodedData,\n    })\n```\n\ngetRewardBalance is a javascript function responsible for calling the contract method called `“accDaiPerToken”` on the Gains Staking contract. it does this by encoding the call data on the interface and then making an RPC call with the `Ethers.provider` code piece to the gainsContract sending the encoded data along. `“accDaiPerToken”` function call takes no params, if it did the the data encoding will change thus: `const encodedData = iface.encodeFunctionData(\"accDaiPerToken\", [param1, param2]);` where param1 and param2 are function parameters of `“accDaiPerToken”`\n\nThis function fetches the reward balance of a user for the staked token. Make sure to adjust this code according to the specific contract functions you want to interact with.\n\n### **Step 5: State Management**\n\nAfter interacting with the contract , you obviously want to manage the variables, you can do so by using state management api on the BOS\n\n**2 functions:**\n\n`State.init` : This is what you use to initialize your contract state , to set default values \n\n`State.update`: This changes values on your state\n\n```\ngetRewardBalance().then((rewards) => {\n        State.update({ rewards });\n      });\n```\n\nIn the snippet above, after calling the getRewardBalance function which calls a contract function to get this value, we await the response and then set it in state using State.update updates a value if found in state, if the value does not exist prior, it sets it.\n\nNote: Styling on the BOS can be done using either “styled components” or “Bootstrap”\n\n\n### **Calling swap methods on Uniswap**\n\nIn case you're wondering how calling a swap method on Uniswap would look like, take a look at this code snippet:\n\n```jsx\nconst SwapToken = () => {\n  const encodedData = uniIface.encodeFunctionData(\"exactInputSingle\", [tokenIn, tokenOut,fee,recipient,deadline,amountIn,amountOutMinimum,sqrtPriceLimitX96]);\n  return Ethers.provider()\n    .call({\n      to: swapRouterContract,\n      data: encodedData,\n    })\n```\n\nThe above snippet is a sample contract call to the uniswap router contract which swaps a token `tokenIn` for another token `tokenOut`.\n\n**More examples of calling swap methods on Uniswap:** https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/guides/swaps/single-swaps\n\n\n## **List of API's for building on ethereum**\n\nBOS has imported the Ethers Library (ethers.js) allowing for seamless connection with Ethereum nodes.\n\nThe Ethers Object Exposes the Provider Connection.\n\n- `Ethers.provider()` - this is a read-only connection to the blockchain which allows querying the blockchain state. This can be used to fetch information about accounts, block or transaction details, or even event logs.\n    - `Ethers().provider().getSigner()` - abstracts the class that interacts with an account.\n    - `Ethers().provider().getBlockNumber()`- Looks up current block number. e.t.c you can reference the [ethers docs](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/getting-started/) for more examples\n    \n\t**Examples**\n\n1. **How to get a User account:**\n    \n    *`const* receiver = Ethers.provider().send(\"eth_requestAccounts\", [])[0];` \n    \n    This single line of code will check for the user-connected account on which ever chain and assign it to the variable `receiver`. Keep in mind that if the user is connected to a web3 wallet (e.g Metamask) it’s going to return a `null` value.\n    \n2. **How to get Current ChainID:** \n    \n    This is very useful when working with multi-chain, it’s good to know which chain the user is connected to, allowing you to throw errors when connected to the wrong chains, also most contract calls needs to be made with the chain Id.\n    \n    ```jsx\n    Ethers.provider().getNetwork().then((chainIdData) => {`\n    \n    `console.log(chainIdData.chainId);`\n    \n    });\n    ```\n    \n    The `chainId` is logged out in the above example, but you could also assign that to a state variable\n    \n3. ****************************How to Retrieve Gas Price:**************************** \n    \n    When interacting with the Ethereum blockchain, it's important to be aware of the current gas prices to estimate transaction fees. The following code snippet demonstrates how to retrieve the current gas price:\n\t\n```\n\nEthers.provider().getGasPrice().then((gasPrice) => {\nconsole.log(Current gas price: ${gasPrice.toString()} Wei);\n});\n```\n\n4. **Fetch Transaction Receipt:**\n    \n    After sending a transaction, it's often necessary to check its status and obtain additional details. The **`getTransactionReceipt`** method can be used for this purpose:\n    \n    ```jsx\n    const txHash = '0xabcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890';\n    \n    Ethers.provider().getTransactionReceipt(txHash).then((receipt) => {\n      console.log(`Transaction Receipt: ${JSON.stringify(receipt, null, 2)}`);\n    });\n    ```\n    \n5. **Query Contract State**\n    \n    ```jsx\n    const contractAddress = '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890';\n    const contractAbi = [...]; // ABI of your contract (After Compiling)\n    \n    For example, if you have a Solidity file named MyContract.sol, compiling it with solc might generate a file like MyContract.json that contains the ABI. \n    \n    const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, contractAbi, Ethers.provider());\n    \n    contract.someReadOnlyFunction().then((result) => {\n      console.log(`Result of read-only function: ${result}`);\n    });\n    \n    // someReadOnlyFunction is just a placeholder for the name of the read-only\n    // function in your contract, so it could be anything based on what's defined\n    // in your contract\n    ```\n    \n    **Note**: When you compile your Solidity contract using a Solidity compiler, such as solc (the Solidity compiler), the compiler will generate various artifacts, including the ABI. This information is often stored in a separate file, usually with a `.json` extension.\n    \n    Also Remember to replace the placeholder values like `txHash`, `contractAddress`, and `contractAbi` with your actual values. \n    \n    **These examples demonstrate different use cases for the `Provider` object in the Ethers library.**\n\t",

          "": "The Blockchain Operating System (BOS) makes it easier to create, share, and use decentralized websites. It's like a toolbox where you can quickly get pieces (components) to build your site. \n\nIt functions as a development and social environment, offering users effortless access to components, seamless forking of other users' components, and convenient deployment on the near network. \n\nIn contrast to Web2 applications, where the typical workflow involves building, pushing changes to GitHub, and then deploying the application, BOS provides a swift alternative. With BOS, users can effortlessly create a component, deploy it on-chain within minutes, and instantly preview their work on a Gateway (near.social or near.org.) \n\nThis eliminates the need to push changes to GitHub, enhancing security by ensuring components remain on-chain. Additionally, deploying on BOS is notably faster than traditional methods, enabling the deployment of new front-ends for smart contracts to the mainnet in a matter of minutes.\n\n## Keywords to Note (The 3 Pillars of BOS)\n\nA few key terms to pay attention to, which you've either encountered or will encounter throughout this article, are crucial for a comprehensive understanding when working with BOS, as they constitute the foundational elements of the system:\n\n***Components***: These are composable frontends that solve specific problems, akin to React, if you're familiar with React, Navigating BOS development would be relatively straightforward. There are also a couple of built-in components that come in handy (I'll be discussing this later).\n\n***Blockchain***: Remember I mentioned the code is being stored on-chain, Think of this as GitHub on how code is being stored on web2, this is to store the component's code as well as assets and data. This is done on the Near chain.\n\n***Gateways***: Think of these as hosting platforms similar to Vercel. Gateways serve as platforms that deliver decentralized frontends (components) to a wider audience. e.g. near.org, near.social\n\n\n## Getting Started\nThe first thing to note when getting started is that you're building on Near and all your changes are being deployed on-chain. Hence, you need to create a near account, and deposit a small token for gas purposes. I recommend utilizing Meteor Wallet and installing its extension in your browser for a swifter experience in saving changes. This is notably faster than employing the mynear app, which redirects you to another window everytime you want to deploy. Saving each time on chain requires you to sign a contract (Don't worry the gas you need to deploy is not much at all, In fact, depending on your project, it might take weeks before you exhaust a single Near token).\n\n***Next Steps...***\nOnce you're done with the step next thing is to start building. Again, this is just my suggestion as I consider the fastest way to build and deploy easily on BOS.\nHead over to `jutsu.ai`, and log in using the near account you just created.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, if you're familiar with React, you would recognize most of the concepts but not everything in React is fully integrated. Currently, only `useState` `useEffect` `useCallback` `useMemo` have been integrated on BOS, I'll be showing you how to use them.\n\n\nIn the Image Example above, I created a simple toggle button component using the useState hook. a couple of things to take note of:\n\n- You don't need import statements, everything is happening behind the scenes, you just need to call the hook.\n\n- whatever JSX code you pass in your return statement is what is being rendered in the preview screen.\n\n- the deploy button on the top-right is used to deploy on-chain and you can view your application in any gateway(Link to the above example, this example took me less than 10 minutes to build and deploy).\n\n- you also have access to your console, which is useful for debugging.\n\n## BOS 101 - How is the BOS VM Different?\n\nThe BOS VM comes with some functions and components already setup, with ongoing additions. It's essential to note that it doesn't function exactly like React, so processes may not align precisely.\n\n- Unlike React, you don't import hooks with statements; you just initialize them when you need them.\n\n- There is no such thing as having a general App.js whereby you have to call the function and export it in order for it to work, that's not how components (BOS) work, just return your JSX code it's that simple.\n\n- You can't just simply download any npm package and import, you have access to a couple of built-in packages that you could work with.\n\n- fetch: the fetch function on BOS acts like a hook, instead of returning a promise, it returns a value.\n\n```\n const res = fetch(\"https://rpc.mainnet.near.org/status\");\n\n return res.body;\n\n```\n\n- `asyncFetch`: this is the version that returns a promise, in case it is mandatory that you handle the API call asynchronously:\n\n```\n function reportUptime() {\n   asyncFetch(\"https://rpc.mainnet.near.org/status\").then((res) => {\n     const uptime = res.body.uptime_sec;\n     Near.call(\"uptime.near\", \"reportUptime\", { uptime });\n   });\n }\n\n return <button onClick={reportUptime}>Report Uptime</button>;\n\n```\n\n- Caching: The VM implements a caching layer for most network requests, but in case you want to handle it manually you have access to the `useCache` hook.\n\n```\n const status = useCache(\n   () =>\n     asyncFetch(\"https://rpc.mainnet.near.org/status\").then((res) => res.body),\n   \"mainnetRpcStatus\",\n   { subscribe: true }\n );\n\n return status;\n\n```\n\n- list of Primitive APIs available on BOS can be found [here](https://docs.near.org/bos/api/primitives)\n\n\n## BOS 102 - Widgets and Props\nWidgets are predefined components (Components that have already been built and deployed) that allow you to include an existing component in your code, Think of it as importing another component in your code, thereby breaking down complex long code to make your code cleaner and live in seperating components. Here are some tips about widgets:\n\n- Widget has a `src` property in which you pass the component you're trying to import, you get an error if your component is wrong or not deployed yet.\n\n- ***Props***: just like React Components, you can also pass in props to widgets but in the VM you have to make sure you call the props and pass your props into the object.\n\nIn the previous example above I defined a useState example, we can see (the Image above) that all I did here was import the component in the form of a widget, and just like that the the component is rendered in this component and we can also build on this as much as we want. This allows us to break large components into smaller bits and make our code cleaner and easily readable.\n\n## Useful built-in Components\n- Image Uploader: for handling image upload on BOS, All images on BOS are uploaded using the built-in component called `IpfsImageUpload` ,the images are uploaded to the near social [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.tech/) and you get the returned hash in an object, you extract the hash from a field called `cid`\n\n```\n const [state, setState] = useState(null)\n\n return (\n   <div className='container row'>\n     <div>\n       Image upload: <br />\n       <IpfsImageUpload image={state} />\n     </div>\n     <div className='mt-2'>\n       {state.img.cid && (\n         <img\n           src={`https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/${state.cid}`}\n           alt='uploaded'\n         />\n       )}\n     </div>\n   </div>\n );\n\n```\n\n- Web3 connect: The BOS is chain-agnostic, making it a flexible solution for developers working with different blockchains (EVM chains like Ethereum, polygon, celo).\n\n```\n return (\n   <div>\n     <Web3Connect /> \n   </div>\n );\n // The Web3Connect Component gives you access to Metamask, Wallet Connect and Ledger\n // In order to connect to different chains\n\n```\n\n## BOS 103 - Styling on BOS\n\nstyling on BOS is quite different from React, as it is done with the built-in Styled Component or Bootstrap, so if you're familiar with either of them you would be able to work style your components easily, if you're not you could always check their docs on getting started.\n\n\n## How to Fork a Widget on BOS\nYes, Forking is also possible on BOS, You can effortlessly fork a component, either to further develop it or to run it locally and study it. In this visual example, I'm utilizing the Near social gateway, and you can find the fork button in the top menu bar on the right.\n\n## Conclusion\nStarting out with Near BOS as a Web2 developer opens up a whole new way to build websites. BOS makes it easy with its toolkit, letting you grab pieces and quickly create your site on the Near network. It's different from how we usually do things on regular websites.\n\nThink of BOS like a box with three important parts: Components, Blockchain, and Gateways. They work together to keep things safe and accessible. It's a simple, secure, and efficient way for Web2 developers to explore the world of decentralized applications. Start your BOS journey and see where it takes you!\n\nFor a deeper understanding on BOS visit the [docs](https://docs.near.org/bos/overview)",

          "": "Developers gathered at the ALX Hub in Lagos, Nigeria for the first-ever in-person hackathon \"WebFusion\" Hosted by DevHub in collaboration with Nearafrica.\n\n### Breaking Barriers 🐣\n\nBlockchain development is often associated with a complicated onboarding process, deterring potential developers. DevHub sought to change this narrative by introducing WebFusion. The primary objective was to provide web developers in Lagos with a seamless transition from Web2 to Web3 using their existing expertise in Javascript and React.\n\nUnlike traditional blockchain development, WebFusion focused on using the BOS, eliminating the need for developers to learn new programming languages. This approach not only simplifies the development process but also encourages a more diverse set of developers to explore the possibilities of blockchain technology.\n\n### Four Days of Non-stop Building 🤯\n\nThe hackathon kicked off with an insightful introduction to the NEAR Ecosystem, followed by an onboarding session led by DevHub DevRel Victor Kanu. For many participants, this marked their introduction into blockchain development. \n\nDevHub also conducted a workshop and a Q&A session guiding developers through the features of NEAR's Blockchain Operating System. The focus was on understanding composable dApps. \n\n### Teams, Collaboration, and Innovation 🤝\n\nThirty developers, eager to embrace the challenges and opportunities of the BOS, formed seven teams for 4 intense days of learning and coding. \n\nThe efforts of the participating teams culminated in some remarkable projects, each showcasing developer talent and the potential of BOS. \n\nThe winning projects included: \n\n1st Place - [PostX](https://taikai.network/hackbox/hackathons/webfusionlagos/projects/clpjwo7fo007z0z01kfk8hqhz/idea) a revolutionary content discovery gateway on the BOS platform, \n2nd place - [Kegha](https://taikai.network/hackbox/hackathons/webfusionlagos/projects/clpk6l8s300bi0z01tim9nv28/idea), a secure linkage between Telegram accounts and BOS profiles, \n3rd Place - [DTECTEET](https://taikai.network/hackbox/hackathons/webfusionlagos/projects/clpkjle4m00e60z01qe46v30o/idea), a detection tool for API calls in widget source code.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nWebFusion Lagos wasn't just about winning prizes, it was about building bridges, fostering growth, and celebrating diversity within the tech community. The event successfully brought together web2 developers, and created an environment ripe for collaboration and sparking groundbreaking projects.\n",

Electron Labs proposed using their code as a test bridge.\n\n- **Wormhole Update**: The Wormhole team shared an update on their architecture plan for bridging using ZK Light Client. The need to determine how to interoperate non-ZK and ZK bridges was raised, since not all chains allow ZK bridges. The team relayed their evaluation of a proof system compatible with all chains. Plonke2 was cited as a good example.\n\n- **ZK Identity**: Reps from Notebook Labs discussed their partnership with NEAR to help projects credential their users, reduce fraud and eliminate bad actors.\n\n\n## ACTION ITEMS\n- Proposal to whitelist ZK qualified auditors by Electron Labs.\n- Proposal to use code as test bridge by Electron Labs.\n- Proposal to use ZK to verify credentials of users of projects on NEAR.",

          "": "\nAs we reflect on the transformative journey of 2023, we are reminded of a year marked by dynamic shifts and growth within the NEAR Developer ecosystem. From the rapid evolution of Open Web technology to the surge in developer engagement, the past year has been nothing short of remarkable for DevHub.\n\n\nAt the onset of 2023, DevHub set out on a mission to redefine what developer engagement truly means. From hosting hackathons in multiple regions to fostering collaborative partnerships, our commitment to empowering developers has remained unwavering. Read all about our highlights and success from the previous year below! \n\n## **📚Empowering the Next Generation of Open Web Developers with NEAR Campus**\n\nOne of the pivotal milestones of 2023 was the launch of NEAR Campus (in October 2023), our initiative aimed at engaging junior software engineers early on as they choose their career path. We’ve been at top schools like University of Oxford and Cambridge. \n\n![Alt Text](https://i.ibb.co/hsGSVSm/NEAR-CAMPUS.png)\n\n\nWith the establishment of university clubs across diverse regions and continents, including Latin America, Asia, Turkey, and Africa, we have successfully cultivated a vibrant ecosystem of more than 100 students. In 2024 we expect to have access to 500 junior developers. \n\nNot only do we engage students, but we also engage with faculty. By providing access to cutting-edge tools and resources, our goal is to integrate NEAR into the standard toolkit for developers in learning institutions.\n&nbsp;\n## **🌎 Decentralizing Developer Relations**\n\nIn Q4, we embarked on a significant revamp of our Developer Relations strategy. Our aim was to make it more accessible and engaging for developers. We achieved this by introducing additional office hours and hosting regular workshops via Twitter Spaces, which led to a notable increase in developer engagement. We also established a consistent presence at hackathons and in-person events. Collaborating closely with the marketing team, we launched challenges and bounty boosters to incentivize participation during these events. \n\nWe also adopted a decentralized approach to DevRel, onboarding team members in locations where hackathons are held rather than having team members travel extensively. This decentralization strategy has led to improvements in tooling, infrastructure, and documentation. Our initial focus has been on the launch of China DevRels, with plans to expand into other regions such as Korea, Brazil, and Asia…where English is not the primary language.\n\n&nbsp;\n## **🏆 Hackathon Innovation with Hackbox**\n\n\nIn 2023 we productized everything we know about Hackathons, bounties and judging submissions…by developing “Hackbox” , a launchpad designed to streamline the hosting of hackathons , guiding first time hosts through setting up , marketing and hosting their own NEAR Hackathon. In collaboration with our vibrant community, we have successfully hosted 4 Hackbox hackathons across different regions, exposing 4,000 individuals to NEAR technology. With over 200 submissions and a keen focus on post-hackathon engagement, we monitor developer activities after every hackathon using “shard-dog” to track GitHub commits and we make sure Developers know what to do in the NEAR ecosystem after they join. \n&nbsp;\n## **🛠 Tooling and Infrastructure**\n\nSignificant progress has been made in enhancing the developer experience, leveraging two robust ecosystems: Rust and JavaScript. In the Rust stack, we're actively developing tools to streamline onboarding processes, including an online IDE that sets up your environment in just 5 minutes.\n\nThis online IDE integrates essential tooling such as `Cargo Near`, `NEAR CLI`, `NEAR Workspaces`, and `NEAR SDK`. While many find our tools intuitive, we're continuously seeking areas for improvement.\n\nTransitioning to the JavaScript stack, we're focused on developing smart contracts using `NEAR SDK JS`. Additionally, our partnerships are facilitating the creation of an interactive education platform for learning `NEAR SDK JS` …so watch out for that!\n\nJutsu, another exciting project in our ecosystem, is seamlessly integrated into Hackbox for an enhanced hackathon experience. Through these tools, we've witnessed individuals familiarize themselves with the technology and deploy applications in less than an hour. They find these tools remarkably user-friendly and conducive to development.\n&nbsp;\n## **The DevHub Portal**\n\nA year ago, we launched the DevHub Portal!  designed to cater to every aspect of a developer's journey within the NEAR ecosystem. Serving as a one-stop shop, it offers a plethora of resources essential for making an impact on NEAR. \n\n\n![Alt Text](https://i.ibb.co/7jRMw8y/Dev-Hub-Portal.png)\n\nHere, developers can share ideas and proposals, seek sponsorship, discover communities, and engage with like-minded individuals on a variety of different topics.\n\nThe development of this portal has been a collaborative effort, with numerous contributors involved in its iterative process. Together, we've implemented features such as community spaces, GitHub integrations, and announcements. Since its inception, the portal has garnered significant engagement, with over 400 unique authors contributing more than 2,000 long-form posts spanning from insightful ideas to detailed solutions.\n\nMoreover, we've provided sponsorship to over 400 projects and individuals, while also overseeing major project transitions such as MyNearWallet and NEAR Blocks. \n\nLooking ahead, we have several exciting features in the pipeline, including a redesign of the proposal journey and the transformation of the portal into a tool accessible not only to DevHub but also to any other partner within the ecosystem!\n&nbsp;\n## 👨🏼‍⚖️Technical Governance\n\nIn our commitment to shaping NEAR's development, we introduced NEAR Enhancement Proposals ([NEPs](https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/neps/nep-0001.md)) . As a way to allow anyone submit proposals, for protocol upgrades, contract standard enhancements, and more. To ensure the credibility and progress of these proposals, we established over 6 formal Working Groups (WGs) comprising of subject matter experts who review and make decisions. Collaborating closely with the community, we have approved over 35 NEPs and discussed more than 75 across various aspects of the tech stack.\n\nEach day, we strive to refine our governance process further. You can revisit the decision-making process through recorded sessions on YouTube or explore the complete history of NEPs on GitHub. Additionally, we've launched numerous community groups, hosting over 35 brainstorming sessions to generate new ideas and solutions, some of which have resulted in the creation of new NEPs.\n\nWe encourage anyone with ideas to propose them and actively participate in our community or start their own! \n&nbsp;\n## Fellowship Program\n\nThrough our fellowship program, we welcomed contributors who have made a significant impact. This initiative resulted in over 1000 commits that contributed to pull requests and the maintenance of more than 20 projects, including CLI SDKs and their dependencies. We're currently polishing the NEAR SDK Rust in preparation for its 5.0 release, thanks to the dedication of our valued contributors who have played a crucial role in our journey.\n&nbsp;\n## Upcoming Initiatives in 2024\n\nLooking ahead of 2024, we have some exciting surprises in store:\n\n1. **Awareness and Engagement:**\n    - We'll be ramping up our efforts to provide more developer-focused content, including blog articles, podcasts, and Twitter Spaces sessions. Additionally, we're opening up these opportunities to the community, inviting everyone to participate in the conversation. Join us at ETH Denver to be a part of it!\n    - We've already launched ongoing challenges, allowing developers to hack on NEAR each month, earn bounties, and gain exclusive access to future hackathons and events.\n2. **NEAR Campus:**\n    - We're launching quarterly cohorts for NEAR Campus, inviting universities and blockchain clubs to join. It's an open application process, and we're actively seeking the best blockchain clubs to onboard. Research grants will also be available.\n3. **Events:**\n    - We're gearing up for four cohorts of Hackbox hackathons and meetups. Additionally, we'll host “Hackbox meets” for those not ready for full-scale hackathons but interested in smaller-scale NEAR meetups. This year, we're supporting five ETH Global hackathons, starting with ETHLondon in March. We're also introducing a NEAR-native hackathon platform.\n4. **DevDAO Operations:**\n    - We're set to relaunch the portal, streamlining payments for our trustees to expedite the process for our contributors. We'll also be scaling partnerships within our organization's ecosystem.\n5. **Tooling:**\n    - Expect top-notch developer experience with enhanced tools for BOS components and other elements of the ecosystem. We're working on out-of-the-box solutions, including AI, zk-SNARKs, multi-chain tools, chain abstraction, and more.\n6. **Regional DevRel Teams:**\n    - We'll be launching regional Developer Relations teams in LATAM and Asia, nurturing regional certified developer programs, and fostering developer incentive programs.\n\nAs we look forward to the exciting year ahead, we invite you to join us on this transformative journey. Together we’ll strengthen the DevHub platform and build a hub where decentralized development knows no bounds.\n\n## Get Involved 🤩\n\n1. **NEAR Campus:** Join us in empowering the next generation of developers through [NEAR Campus](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=community&handle=near-campus&tab=about-us).\n2. **Host a Hackathon / Meetup:** Explore the possibilities of [Hackbox](https://near.org/hackbox.near/widget/home) and host your own NEAR meetup.\n3. **Contribute:** Share your ideas and proposals on the [DevHub Portal](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=feed) and become a part of our vibrant community of innovators.",

          "": "**In recent news, NEAR announced a partncership with LAVA network to scale the RPC service providers by incentivising node operators. Let's take this opportunity to talk about what these RPC nodes are and how to run one ourselves.***\n\n## What is an RPC node?\nAn RPC (Remote Procedure Call) node is a system that connects the blockchain with the outside world. This way, users and applications can request information from the blockchain through these RPC nodes and send transactions to be processed.\n\n#### Why would we want to run an RPC node?\nOne would want to run their own RPC node for multiple reasons. One reason might be having a dedicated RPC for your users and applications so you do not need to rely on public RPCs that might get congested. Another reason is to contribute your node to a private RPC endpoint to help it scale, thus improving the throughput of the network services.\n\n#### Before we start\nThis article will follow the official node docs, focusing on setting up a basic node for testnet.\n\n`warning: This article will not dwell on server security (e.g., setting up firewalls, rate limiters, etc). We encourage you to read more about hardening (securing) your server and its services.`\n\n#### The Hardware\nThe recommended hardware section on the node docs lists the following config:\n\nHardware\nRecommended Specifications\nCPU\n8-Core (16-Thread) Intel i7/Xeon or equivalent with AVX support|\nCPU Features\nCMPXCHG16B, POPCNT, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX\nRAM\n20GB DDR4\nStorage\n1TB NVMe SSD\n\n\n\nRPC nodes store the last five epochs of data, requiring a large amount of storage to accommodate this. However, this amount may vary due to network activity and protocol upgrades, so it's always better to exceed the recommendations a bit.\n\nIf we don't have a machine with such specifications, we can choose a server provider such as Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, Hetzner, or OVH, just to name a few.\n\n#### Setting up\nAfter spinning up our server, we can begin setting up our node.\n\n\tinfo\n\tSince it is a popular distribution, we will use `Ubuntu 22.04`, so your actual command lines may vary.\n\nThe following lines will install the necessary packages needed by nearcore and some tools that we will need later.\n\n```bash\n# Update system and install relevant apps\n$ sudo apt update\n$ sudo apt install -y git binutils-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev zlib1g-dev libdw-dev libiberty-dev cmake gcc g++ python-is-python3 docker.io protobuf-compiler libssl-dev pkg-config clang llvm cargo awscli httpie\n\n# Install Rust\n$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\n$ source \"$HOME/.cargo/env\"\n```\n\n#### Getting and Compiling nearcore\nWhen writing the latest `nearcore` release is `1.37.0`, make sure to check the latest version on the GitHub repo.\n\nLet's clone the repository, compile the code, and move the resulting binary into `/usr/local/bin`\n\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/near/nearcore\n$ cd nearcore\n$ git fetch origin --tags\n$ git checkout tags/1.36.5 -b my_rpc_node\n$ make release\n$ sudo mv /nearcore/target/release/neard /usr/local/bin/neard\n```\n\n#### Initialize a working directory\nTo run an RPC node we need to initialize a working directory, obtaining the genesis configuration of the blockchain.\n\n```\n$ neard init --chain-id testnet --download-genesis\n$ wget https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/build.nearprotocol.com/nearcore-deploy/testnet/config.json -P ~/.near/\n```\n\n`warning\nWe recommend you run this command with a designated [service account](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/314725/what-is-the-difference-between-user-and-service-account). Do not run it as the `root` user.`\n\n#### Replacing the default configuration\nLet's remove the default configuration and get the pre-populated one provided by NEAR.\nSyncing with the last backup\nAs a final step before running the node, we must first sync up with the network. This means our node needs to download all the headers and blocks that other nodes in the network already have.\n\nBackups are frequently updated, so we need to determine which one is the latest before syncing the data from it.\n\n```\n$ aws s3 --no-sign-request cp s3://near-protocol public/backups/testnet/rpc/latest .\n$ LATEST=$(cat latest)\n$ aws s3 --no-sign-request cp --no-sign-request --recursive s3://near-protocol-public/backups/testnet/rpc/$LATEST ~/.near/data\n```\n\n`info`: This will take a while, so you might want to make use of [screen](https://quickref.me/screen) or [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki), which we will not be covered in this article\n\n#### Running the node\nStart the node by running\n\n```bash\n$ neard --home /root/.near run\n```\n\nOur node has synced with the last backup available, but since some time has passed, it will need to catch up with the remaining blocks it missed. At this point, it is normal to see messages such as:\n\n`WARN chunks: Error processing partial encoded chunk response: UnknownChunk`\nor\n`ERROR network: Failed to store connection attempt. peer_info=PeerInfo ....`\n\nAfter a while, it should have caught up with the network, and the logs output would look similar:\n\n\n\n**Congratulations! Our node is running, and we will see the logs output as long as we keep the process alive.**\n\n#### Persisting the process\nExplain [todo]\nCreate a `near.service` file in `/etc/systemd/system/` with the following content:\n\n```\n[Unit]\nDescription=NEAR RPC node\nAfter=network-online.target\n\n[Service]\nUser=root\nExecStart=/usr/local/bin/neard --home /root/.near run\nRestart=always\nRestartSec=10\nLimitNOFILE=65535\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\nTo make use of our newly created service, we should reload systemctl and enable it\n\n```\n$ systemctl daemon-reload\n$ systemctl enable near.service\n$ systemctl start near\n```\n\nOnce the process starts, we can use the following command to follow the output logs\n\n```\njournalctl --fu near -o cat\n```\n\nThis time if we hit `[ctrl]+[c]` the logs would be closed, but our node will continue running in the background.\nInteract locally\n\nNow that our node is up and running persistently, it is ready to receive http requests via `http://localhost:3030`. To learn more on how to interact with RPC nodes, we can refer to the documentation [found here](https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/introduction#near-rpc---quick-links)\n\nLet's get the answer to life, the universe, and everything by calling the function `get_answer` on the smart contract deployed on `the_answer.testnet`.\n\nTo make the call, we will use [httpie](https://httpie.io/), which we installed already with the packages in the beginning\n\n```\n$ http post http://localhost:3030 jsonrpc=2.0 id=dontcare method=query \\  params:='{    \n    \"request_type\": \"call_function\",    \n    \"finality\": \"final\",    \n    \"account_id\": \"the_answer.testnet\",    \n    \"method_name\": \"get_answer\",    \n    \"args_base64\": \"e30=\"  \n}'\n```\n\n#### Interact from across the world\nIf we try accessing the running service from outside of our server, it will fail because the service is only accessible from within our machine or the local network we are part of. While port forwarding is an option, setting up a reverse proxy is a much better approach.\n\n**What is a reverse proxy?**\n> *A reverse proxy is a server that sits before web servers and forwards client (e.g., web browser) requests to those web servers. Reverse proxies are typically implemented to help increase security, performance, and reliability*.\n> [CloudFlare on proxies](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/)\nReverse Proxy with NGINX\n[NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) is an open-source web server that can also be used for load balancing, server caching and as a reverse proxy.\n\n\n\nNow that we have a general idea of what *reverse proxy* is and how it would benefit our node, let's go ahead and Install nginx.\n\n```\n$ apt install nginx\n```\n\nWe should create an nginx server config file in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`\nWe can name the file anything we want, but usually, the name would be the domain name we are configuring.\n\n*We can learn more about on nginx and configuration on the [nginx docs](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/)*\n\nLet's go with `myRPC` with the following content\n\n```\n# content of /etc/nginx/sites-available/myRPC\n\nserver {\n\tlisten 80;\n\tlisten [::]:80;\n\n\tserver_name YOUR_SERVER_IP_HERE; # or domain name if you have set one up\n\n\tlocation / {\n    \tproxy_pass http://localhost:3030;\n    \tinclude proxy_params;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nWe can test our nginx config with the following command\n\n```\n$ nginx -t\n```\n\nAfter ensuring that our configurations are correct, we can enable our server by linking to it in the `sites-enabled` directory.\n\n```\n$ ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myRpc /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/\n$ systemctl restart nginx\n```\n\nWe can use httpie from our personal computer (or anywhere in the world really) and interact with the node from outside of the local network of our server\n\n```\n$ http post http://123.123.123 jsonrpc=2.0 id=dontcare method=query \\\n  params:='{\n\t\"request_type\": \"call_function\",\n\t\"finality\": \"final\",\n\t\"account_id\": \"the_answer.testnet\",\n\t\"method_name\": \"get_answer\",\n\t\"args_base64\": \"e30=\"\n  }'\n```\n\nA successfully returned query will include `\"result\":` with an array of bytes `[52, 50]` in JavaScript we can turn it into a human-readable string like so\n\n```js\nString.fromCharCode(...[52, 50])\n'42'\n```\n\n#### Enabling SSL\n\nIf we already have a domain pointed to our server, enabling SSL can be relatively easy using guided tools such as [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/).\n\nWe must use a Self-Signed Certificate if we need to get a domain name but want to add SSL to NGINX. Luckily, some articles cover this already, such as [this one](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-nginx-in-ubuntu-20-04-1) from DigitalOcean.\n\nAfter enabling SSL, our config file in `sites-available` would look something like this:\n\n```\nserver {\n\tlisten [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on; # managed by Certbot\n\tlisten 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot\n\n\tserver_name YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE; # your domain here\n\n\tssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot\n\tssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE; # managed by Certbot\n\tinclude /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot\n\tssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot\n\n\tlocation / {\n    \tproxy_pass http://localhost:3030;\n\t}\n}\n\nserver {\n\tif ($host = YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE) {\n    \treturn 301 https://$host$request_uri;\n\t} # managed by Certbot\n\n\tlisten 80;\n\tlisten [::]:80;\n\n\tserver_name YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE;\n\treturn 404; # managed by Certbot\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Conclusion\nIn this article, we delved a bit into RPC nodes, which serve as pivotal connectors between applications and the blockchain.\n\nAt this point, we have a running node ready to use as a personal service. Before opening it to the public, we should secure the server further and implement rate limiting.\n",

          "": "## What is the NEAR Protocol Explorer?\nBefore we dive into the nitty-gritty, let’s get acquainted with the NEAR Protocol Explorer. Picture it as a high-tech crystal ball, offering a transparent view of all the activities happening on the NEAR blockchain. From transactions and accounts to contracts and changes in state, this explorer lets you peek into the blockchain’s soul without performing any dark magic. It’s user-friendly, accessible, and doesn’t require chanting in binary.\nKey Definitions to Keep in Your Toolkit\n\n**Transaction:** This is the backbone of the NEAR blockchain, a record that says, “Hey, something just happened!” Whether it’s transferring NEAR tokens, calling a smart contract, or creating a new account, transactions are the lifeblood of the blockchain’s functionality.\nAccount: Think of this as your digital identity on the NEAR platform. It’s where your tokens live and how you interact with smart contracts. Unlike traditional blockchains, NEAR accounts have human-readable names, not just a string of confusing characters.\n\n**Block:** A bundle of transactions processed and recorded together. Blocks are chained together (hence, blockchain) to create a secure and unalterable ledger of all transactions.\nGas: No, not the kind you need to fill up your car. In NEAR, gas refers to the computational effort required to execute transactions. Think of it as the “fuel” for the blockchain.\n\n**Smart Contract:** A self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. It’s like a vending machine for transactions: input your request, and the contract automatically executes the agreed-upon outcome.\n\n### Reading a Transaction: Step-by-Step\n\n**1. Finding the Transaction**\nStart your journey on the NEAR Protocol Explorer homepage. Here, you can search for a specific transaction by its hash (a unique identifier), or you can browse through blocks to discover recent transactions. It’s like being a blockchain detective, looking for clues in a digital landscape.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Transaction Details**\nOnce you’ve clicked on a transaction, you’ll be greeted with a plethora of details. Here’s how to make sense of them:\n\n- **Transaction Hash:** The unique identifier for this transaction. It’s like a fingerprint but for digital actions.\n\n- **Sender:** The account that initiated the transaction. Think of it as the “from” address in a digital checkbook.\n\n- **Receiver:** The account receiving the transaction. This could be another user or a smart contract.\n\n- **Status:** Whether the transaction succeeded, failed, or is still pending. It’s the blockchain’s version of a delivery confirmation.\n\n- **Timestamp:** The exact moment the transaction was processed—a digital timestamp for your blockchain activities.\n\n- **Gas Used:** This tells you how much computational effort was required to execute the transaction. It’s like the receipt for the fuel your transaction consumed.\n\n**3. Understanding the Transaction Type**\nTransactions on NEAR can be as simple as transferring tokens or as complex as deploying a smart contract. By examining the transaction details, you can understand what action was performed. Each type has nuances, but the explorer provides clear descriptions to guide you through.\n\n### Execution Details: A Closer Look\n\nWhen a transaction is submitted to the NEAR blockchain, it goes through several steps:\nValidation: Think of this as the entrance exam for your transaction. NEAR checks if your transaction has a valid signature (like a correct password) and if you have enough balance to pay for the transaction’s gas cost (like checking if you have enough fuel in your car).\n\n**Routing:** Your transaction then takes a trip to its designated shard. NEAR uses sharding to split the network into manageable pieces, making everything faster and more scalable.\n\n**Execution:** This is where the magic happens. The NEAR network processes it according to what your transaction aims to do (like transferring tokens or executing a smart contract). This processing involves running the specific code of your transaction and updating the blockchain’s state to reflect the change.\n\nThe execution detail of a transaction, therefore, encompasses the steps taken by the blockchain to validate, route, and execute the transaction, including any changes made to the state and the computational resources consumed to perform these actions.\n\n### Tips for the Novice NEAR Explorer Detective\n\n- **Keep It Simple:** Start with basic transactions, like transfers, to familiarize yourself with the explorer’s layout.\n\n- **Use Filters:** Leverage the explorer’s filtering tools to narrow your search. It’s like using a magnifying glass to find the necessary clue.\n\n- **Explore Smart Contracts:** Be bold and dive into smart contract transactions. They offer a fascinating glimpse into the programmable side of NEAR.\n\nCongratulations! You’ve just decrypted the basics of reading and understanding transactions on the NEAR Protocol Explorer.\n\n### One More Byte: Understanding Gas\n\n**Gas** is essentially the fuel that powers transactions on NEAR. It covers the computational efforts required to validate, route, and execute transactions. Here’s a breakdown:\n\n**Purpose:** Gas limits the work needed to process transactions, protects the network from potential abuse, and ensures a fair resource allocation among users. This fee is paid to validators as a reward for processing transactions and securing the network.\n\n**Gas Price:** The cost of gas varies based on network demand and is set by validators. You can think of it as surge pricing in ride-sharing apps, where the cost increases with demand.\n\n**Gas Limit:** When you initiate a transaction, you’ll set a maximum gas limit you’re willing to use. It’s a way to control your spending and avoid unexpected costs. The default is often 300 Tgas.\n\n**Gas Usage and Refunds**\nAfter executing your transaction, the actual gas used is tallied up. If it’s less than your limit, NEAR refunds the difference. This process makes transactions efficient and economical, as you only pay for the resources you use.\n\n### For Users and Developers\n\n- Users should learn to adjust gas limits and prices to optimize their transaction costs.\n\n- Developers need to write gas-efficient code, especially for complex operations that could guzzle up computational resources. 30% of gas fees spent on the contract execution will go to a contract’s account itself; simply using it will bring some income. Due to the cheap gas cost, this will make a significant impact only for the most popular and often-called contracts, but it’s nice to have such an option nonetheless.\n\n",

This effort includes consolidating information on basics, state/storage, functions, and interfaces.\n   - Links to migrated documentation:\n     - [Basics Documentation](https://docs-preview-pr-1919.onrender.com/build/smart-contracts/anatomy/)\n     - [State/Storage Documentation](https://docs-preview-pr-1919.onrender.com/build/smart-contracts/anatomy/functions)\n     - [Functions and Interface Documentation](https://docs-preview-pr-1919.onrender.com/build/smart-contracts/anatomy/functions)\n\n2. **Documentation Maintenance:**\n   - Several broken links within existing documentation have been identified and addressed.\n   - Ongoing updates and improvements are being made to documentation pages to enhance clarity.\n\n3. **New Documentation feature:**\n\n- Code Navigator was released on docs 🚨🎉, A new tool in docs that's able to better explain code-related concepts! Please check it and give us feedback so we can improve it! Click 👉[here](https://docs.near.org/build/smart-contracts/anatomy/).\n\n\n4. **Sample Code Repositories:**\n   - GitHub repositories for auction examples and storage examples have been shared within the community, providing developers with useful code snippets and resources.\n   - [Auction Examples Repository](https://github.com/near-examples/auction-examples)\n   - [Storage Examples Repository](https://github.com/near-examples/storage-examples)\n\n\n5. **Developer Tools Optimization:**\n   - Efforts towards dependencies cleanup and potential refactoring of NEAR crates are underway.

The full component library is expected to be ready for use by the end of the following week.\n\n\n\n8. **Serialization Clarifications:**\n   - Discussions have clarified the usage of NearToken and U128 for serialization purposes, ensuring efficient handling of data structures in contracts.\n\n9. **Developer Queries Resolution:**\n   - Queries regarding the serialization of u64/u128 in structs and the necessity of creating separate structs for storing in contracts and returning as function outputs have been addressed within the community. It was clarified that it's not necessary to create separate structs for storing in contracts and returning as function outputs. Instead, developers can use the **NearToken** struct for both cases and implement JSON and Borsh serialization for this single struct. **NearToken** is serialized as a native u128 for Borsh and as a string-encoded number for JSON, ensuring efficient serialization for both formats. This resolution simplifies development processes and ensures consistency in handling u64/u128 data types within contracts.\n\n10. **SDK Review and Discussions:**\n   - Ongoing discussions and reviews of tools and libraries such as near-api-js have taken place, focusing on best practices for contract calling methods and key management approaches.\n\n11. **cargo-near Build Tool Development:**\n    - Development of the `cargo-near build` tool is in progress to assist with reproducible builds and linking compiled wasm contracts with their code, providing solutions for consistent builds across different computers.\n    - 👉[GitHub Pull Request #134](https://github.com/near/cargo-near/pull/134) outlines the ongoing development and testing process.\n\n12. **SDK Version Compatibility:**\n    - Updates have been made to SDK versions to ensure compatibility with the latest tools and libraries, facilitating smoother development workflows.\n\n13. **Pagoda:** \n- Improved QueryAPI logging system and DB connection pooling resulting in ~2-10 times better indexing performance.\n- KitWallet has been migrated to use QueryAPI for Access Keys indexer, making it more reliable for wallets that still use KitWallet.\n- QueryAPI hit all-time-high of 1.05M requests on April 26th, peaking at 400 req/second with ~250ms 95th percentile and ~15ms median GraphQL response time.\n\n14. **Automated Verification Processes:**\n    - Plans for automation of `cargo-near` verify processes are in place to streamline developer workflows and enhance code verification efficiency.\n\n15. **Developer Feedback Solicitation:**\n    - Developers have been encouraged to provide feedback on tools, libraries, and documentation to drive continuous improvement and enhance the developer experience.\n\n16: **New Framework for Indexers: inindexer:**\n- [inindexer](https://github.com/INTEARnear/inindexer) is a new framework that allows you to build your own custom indexer to react to the transactions and other events on chain (Examples are included).

          "": "\n\n\nWelcome to NEAR Dev NEWS, your prime source for the latest in the NEAR Developer ecosystem! NEAR lays the groundwork for all blockchain apps, offering an open-source system empowering devs to create fully decentralized, interoperable apps. Our Digest showcases developer progress and technical updates shaping the blockchain OS.\n\nBefore we kick into updates for the new week, please take the time to fill it out our survey and play a pivotal role in shaping the ecosystem. Your feedback will provide valuable info to builders and contributors, paving the way for FRPs (Request for proposals) on DevHub. \n\n###### [CLICK HERE TO FILL SURVEY 🏆](https://bit.ly/devhub-survey-q1-2024)\n\nThank you for participating, now let’s get into the updates!\n\n&nbsp; \n### FEATURED RELEASES & PR's 🤩\n\n- `nearcore`: Version 1.38.0 has been released . This contains a protocol upgrade. learn more 👉 [here](https://github.com/near/nearcore/releases/tag/1.38.0)\n\n- `VM` [Released version 2.6.0](https://github.com/NearSocial/VM/releases/tag/2.6.0): VM execution layer for decentralized frontend components.\n\n- `near-sdk-rs` [Released version near-sdk-v5.0.0](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/releases/tag/near-sdk-v5.0.0): Rust SDK for writing smart contracts.\n\n- `near-cli-rs`: 0.8.0 -> 0.8.1 (✓ API compatible changes). To update `near` CLI use: near extensions `self-update`\n\n- Discover more in releases and merged pull requests in our changelog 👉 [here](https://docs.near.org/changelog/2024/02/29/#-documentation).\n\n\n&nbsp; \n### DEVELOPER UPDATES 🛠\n\n- Next release of `near-api-js` will include the ability to select transaction finality. Release expected in the next couple of days.\n\n- Developers are exploring the implementation of a broadcast_tx_async-based wallet to enhance user experience within the NEAR ecosystem.\n\n- `New Documentation`: Discover how your NEAR account can control accounts on other chains, such as Ethereum, through Chain Signatures. Learn more in our new articles:\n\n👉[What are Chain Signatures?](https://docs.near.org/concepts/abstraction/chain-signatures)\n👉[Create a Chain Signature](https://docs.near.org/abstraction/chain-signatures)\n\n- Chain Abstraction, What is it? Learn about it 👉 [here](https://twitter.com/NEARDevHub/status/1772615619168403619).\n\n- Learn about Chain Abstractions goals 👉 [here](https://twitter.com/ilblackdragon/status/1770890267018535308).\n\n- Community members compare gas costs between contracts compiled from JavaScript SDK and contracts compiled from Rust to WASM, revealing significant differences in gas consumption.\n\n👉 Rust based WASM: [Transaction Link](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/txns/J8MiLqghiWxRWhogsZSRVYYaJx4WRbAKcUuM1xMDu5fJ#)\n👉 JS based WASM: [Transaction Link](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/txns/25MufUqsgeuQAJ9EZXKdSgrjuCmMHHFyMtNKx1i9Fe9q#)\n\nReason: Rust's strong typing and memory safety features can lead to more robust and secure contracts, but they also introduce additional overhead in terms of gas costs due to the need for stricter memory management and error handling mechanisms. \n\n- Check out this deep dive into [Lava Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-16v_h0s5s). To stay updated on cutting edge tech, be sure to check out the rest of our [whiteboard series](https://www.youtube.com/@NEARProtocol/search?query=whiteboard)!\n\n- We received positive feedback on community tools' functionality and smooth operation. Efte, a member of our tools community shares thoughts: \"Yea I am pretty happy with tooling by now, Everything works smooth and I like it a lot.\nWould be happy to work together with somebody to create FT, NFT and / or cross contract call walkthroughs and youtube videos even\".\n\n- There's been discussions on the possibility of re-deploying contracts from JavaScript to Rust while preserving state. It's possible, but you will need to make sure that your Rust version can read the serialized data stored in the state. You can use `near.cli.rs` to view your contract storage to make that decision: `near contract view-storage`. \n\n- **DevHub** announces a significant upgrade to DevHub that revolutionizes the funding journey. Detailed information about the revamped proposal submission and funding process aligned with DevDAO's mission can be found 👉 [here](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=blog&id=3251).\n\n- Discussion on renaming `near-cli-rs` to reduce confusion in the ecosystem, suggesting `inear` (Interactive NEAR) as an alternative.\n\n- Confirmation that contracts can be annotated using either the verbose 5.0.0 way or the concise 5.1+ way, providing flexibility and backward compatibility.\n\n- Consideration of handling annotations in documentation, particularly the transition from `#[near_bindgen]` to `#[near]`, is discussed because there's a shift in the SDK's approach to contract annotations. With the release of SDK 5.1+, the #[near] annotation is introduced as a more concise alternative to #[near_bindgen]. This transition is significant for developers as it affects how they annotate their contracts and interact with the NEAR ecosystem. \n\nBy adopting #[near], developers can reduce the boilerplate code and make their contracts more concise, enhancing readability and maintainability. There's also a discussion on the importance of handling contract annotations in the documentation.\n\n-  Interest expressed in FastAuth, an authentication mechanism for NEAR Protocol, aimed at simplifying onboarding and account recovery. You can find more information about FastAuth here: \n\n👉 [NEAR Wiki](https://wiki.near.org/overview/BOS/fast-auth) \n👉 [NEAR blog](https://pages.near.org/blog/fastauth-sdk-beta-now-available/)\n\nIt's also mentioned that FastAuth should work on testnet, and while there might not be extensive example implementations readily available, contributions to improve documentation and examples are welcome. [Documentation Community](https://t.me/neardocscg)\n\n- Users encounter errors while attempting to create accounts on NEAR testnet. The issue appears to stem from account creation scripts lacking necessary private key configurations. Community members provide troubleshooting advice and code snippets to resolve the issue. [Link to discussions](https://t.me/neardev/41846)\n\n- A recent change in the NEAR RPC API caused disruptions for some applications, prompting concerns about backward compatibility and proper deprecation warnings. However, the change has since been reverted to address the issue and ensure continuity for developers relying on the NEAR RPC API. \n\n- Stay updated with the NEAR Validator upgrade: [NEAR Validator Update](https://pages.near.org/blog/an-update-on-the-near-validator-upgrade/?ssp=1&setlang=en&cc=AT&safesearch=moderate).\n\n-  Ecosystem Developers explore methods for updating contract metadata and ensuring changes propagate to indexers. [Join Tools Community](https://t.me/NEAR_Tools_Community_Group)\n\n- Community members discuss NEAR Protocol contract addresses and share pull requests for fixing issues in NEAR Lake Indexer. [Join Near dev community](https://t.me/neardev)\n\n- Join us as we celebrate the activation of six shards on NEAR Protocol!\n\n- Explore `near-api-js` updates and signing messages guidance in the [near-api-js Cookbook](https://github.com/near/near-api-js/blob/master/packages/cookbook/utils/verify-signature.js).\n\n- In the next release of `near-api-js`, you will be able to choose the finality of the transaction using the new `send_tx` method. This release will be live in the next couple of days. See the changes [here](https://github.com/near/nearcore/blob/447572bb775a5954ca7a5a4b65c85b45aab9e499/chain/jsonrpc/CHANGELOG.md#023).\n\n- A participant shared their website, which won a prize in the NEAR Hacks hackathon. https://nearvisionai.streamlit.app/.  more can be found on the results page https://nearhacks.hackerearth.com/. \n\n- Ongoing development on a new API wrapper aimed at reducing boilerplate code.\n\n- We had discussions on integrating BOS's Social API into a Node.js project with suggestions for creating a wrapper using naxios.\nCheck out 👉[Naxios Repository](https://github.com/wpdas/naxios). \n\n- An issue was raised regarding refunding users for storage usage in a contract, where the function returned the same value at the start and end. Suggestions were provided to force changes to storage by calling `.flush()` on the collections if using `near_sdk::store` collections.\n\n- A user discussed an issue with `near-sdk-js` where a JS error occurred during build, potentially related to contract state initialization. Suggestions included trying to deploy to a fresh account and avoiding inheritance with `@NearBindgen`. Check out 👉 [NEAR SDK JS repo](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-js). \n\n&nbsp; \n### THIS WEEKS TIPS 💡\n\n- `Tip`: For more resources on Chain Signatures, check out this 👉 [linktree](https://linktr.ee/chainsignatures).\n\n- `Tip`: Engage with the  [Documentation Community](https://t.me/neardocscg) for updates, clarifications, and alignment with actual usage and best practices.\n\n- `Tip`: If you run a TESTNET validator node, please update it to the [1.38 version](https://github.com/near/nearcore/releases/tag/1.38.0-rc.2).

After collaborating with hundreds of community contributors and organizations, we’ve completely revamped the proposal submission and funding process. This makes it easier to submit, review, and approve proposals aligned with DevDAO’s mission of fostering a thriving NEAR developer community.\n\nExplore the new experience on the [Proposal Feed](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=proposals).\n\n## What’s new?\n* **A Clear Journey:** Our new structured proposal format and dedicated feed make it easy to understand requirements and submit proposals to DevDAO.\n* **Enhanced Transparency:** Track progress and understand the rationale behind funding decisions with clear updates and timelines.\n* **KYC/KYB Integration:** Verification with Fractal helps establish the identity of recipients, prompting trust and compliance.\n* **Focused Collaboration:** Better tools for all participants to actively discuss, comment, and collaborate within each proposal.\n* **Decentralized & Transparent Decisions:** Community involvement and clear rationale guide funding choices, fostering trust in the process.\n\n## Pilot Program with DevDAO\nFor the initial launch, the new proposal experience offers a clear and organized way to submit and manage funding requests specifically from DevDAO, the main entity behind DevHub. We focus on funding projects that drive developer growth:\n\n* **DevTools**: SDKs, CLIs, IDEs, and documentation (Rust and JS stacks) that streamline development.\n* **DevRel**: Activities that onboard and engage developers including tutorials, guides, onboarding experiences, community support channels, and IRL/online events.\n* **DevHub Portal**: Building essential tools for managing proposals, treasury, and community collaboration.\n\n## Get Involved\nThe DevHub Portal is a vibrant hub where diverse communities connect, collaborate, and find resources for building on NEAR. The new proposal experience streamlines a key aspect – funding for developer-centric projects.\n\n* **Have a proposal?** Head over to the [Proposal Feed](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=proposals).\n* **Need guidance?** Review our detailed [funding guidelines](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=community&handle=developer-dao&tab=funding).\n* **Want to connect?** Catch the latest announcements and join the discussions in our various [communities](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=communities).\n\n## What About the Old Activity Feed?\nDon't worry, the conversations from the old activity feed are still archived [here](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=feed)!\n\n## What’s next?\nThis pilot phase with DevDAO focuses on streamlining the funding process, laying the groundwork for a model that can empower other organizations within the NEAR ecosystem. We’re working on further automating the process and creating tools for efficient decision-making and treasury management. Your feedback is crucial. Let us know how we can improve by contributing to the discussions in the [DevHub Portal](https://near.social/devhub.near/widget/app?page=community&handle=devhub-platform&tab=discussions) community.\n",

          "": "\nSerialization plays a crucial role in Rust smart contracts, particularly when it comes to the storage and manipulation of Merkle trees. While the merkletree crate is a powerful tool for constructing them, they do not implement serialization methods or functions. So, let’s take a deeper look into the significance of serialization and how it impacts how these data structures are stored and utilized within smart contracts.\n\n### Serialization in Rust Smart Contracts\n&nbsp; \nWhen working with Merkle trees in Rust, how the tree nodes are serialized can profoundly affect the efficiency and security of the smart contract. Serialization involves converting the in-memory representation of the Merkle tree into a format that can be stored, transmitted, or hashed. The choice of serialization format and the specific implementation details can significantly influence the size of the data, the speed of serialization and deserialization processes, and the overall performance of the smart contract.\n\nWhile the near_sdk’s near macro supports serialization (and deserialization) with borsh and serde,  it's crucial to understand the implications of this abstraction. By relying solely on the derived implementations, developers may overlook the opportunity to optimize based on the specific requirements of their smart contract, where custom serialization logic may sometimes be necessary to achieve better performance, reduce storage costs, or ensure compatibility with external systems. This understanding empowers developers to decide on the best project serialization strategy.\n&nbsp; \n### Custom vs. Standard\n&nbsp; \nUsing libraries like serde and borsh for serialization in Rust provides a standardized, flexible approach with support for various formats and a suite of advanced features, which can streamline integration and reduce boilerplate code. However, the convenience of these general-purpose libraries can come with trade-offs, including potential performance and binary size overhead. These drawbacks might be critical in resource-constrained or high-throughput environments, and developers must know them to make the right project choices.\n\nCustom serialization can be a game-changer. By implementing serialization logic tailored to the data structure, developers can optimize for performance and gain fine-grained control over the process. In the case of a Merkle tree, a custom serialization function can be remarkably efficient. By bypassing the overhead of a generic library, custom serialization can outperform existing libraries in terms of speed and memory usage. However, this approach also increases the developer's responsibility for the code's correctness and security, as it lacks the reliability of libraries like serde or borsh. While offering flexibility for specific use cases, custom serialization can complicate maintainability and adaptability, potentially increasing the codebase's complexity and effort required for future modifications.\n\nIn the following section of this article, we will explore custom serialization. By examining the code and discussing some of the trade-offs, we aim to help developers decide if and when this approach is a better option, empowering them to make informed decisions based on their specific project requirements and constraints.\n&nbsp; \n### Compressing NFTs with a Merkle Tree\n&nbsp; \nMerkle trees have emerged as a powerful data structure in smart contracts, offering a novel approach to data compression and efficient state management. By leveraging the inherent properties of Merkle trees, smart contracts can significantly reduce storage requirements and optimize data verification processes. To illustrate this concept, let's explore a smart contract that compresses NFT data to minimize gas costs during minting.\n&nbsp; \n**For this example, we wrote the CompressedDataContract smart contract:**\n&nbsp; \n- Utilizes the NEAR protocol's SDK and leverages the merkletree crate to construct and manage the Merkle tree \n- Employs the sha2 crate for hashing purposes. \n- A custom `Sha256Digest hasher` ensures compatibility with the Merkle tree implementation. \n- The contract also provides essential functionality for creating new instances, updating and verifying the Merkle root, and performing data-related operations. \n&nbsp; \n**The contract implements serialization and deserialization methods to facilitate the storage and transmission of the Merkle tree data:**\n\n&nbsp; \n- Serialization takes the Merkle tree data and converts it into a compact binary format suitable for storage. \n- Deserialization reverses the process, taking the serialized binary data and reconstructing the Merkle tree structure in memory.\n- They are optimized for the specific requirements of the Merkle tree data structure, and consider the characteristics of the Merkle tree, such as the fixed-size hashes and the tree's hierarchical structure, to ensure efficient storage and retrieval operations.\n\nUltimately, the objective is to significantly reduce storage costs and gas consumption using custom serialization techniques. We want the compact binary representation of the Merkle tree data to minimize the amount of data that needs to be stored on the blockchain, resulting in lower storage fees.\n\n\n&nbsp; \n**Let's take a closer look at a custom serialization method for merkle trees in Rust:**\n&nbsp; \n```rust\npub fn serialize_merkle_tree_data(&self) -> Vec<u8> {\n    let mut serialized_data = vec![0u8; 32 * self.merkle_tree_data.len()];\n    let mut start = 0;\n    let mut end = 32;\n    \n    for element in &self.merkle_tree_data {\n        serialized_data[start..end].copy_from_slice(element);\n        start += 32;\n        end += 32;\n    }\n    \n    serialized_data\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we have a `serialize_merkle_tree_data` method that takes a reference to `self` and returns a `Vec<u8>` representing the serialized Merkle tree data.\n\nThe method begins by creating a mutable vector called `serialized_data` with a length equal to 32 times the number of elements in `self.merkle_tree_data`. This ensures that the serialized data will have enough capacity to store all the elements.\n\nNext, we initialize two variables, `start` and `end`, to keep track of the current range within serialized_data, where each element will be copied.\n\nWe iterate over each `element` in `self.merkle_tree_data` using a for loop. We use the `copy_from_slice` method for each element to copy its bytes into the corresponding range of `serialized_data`, specified by `start..end`.\n\nAfter copying each `element`, we increment `start` and `end` by 32 to move to the next range in serialized_data for the subsequent element.\n&nbsp; \n**Finally, we return the `serialized_data` vector containing the serialized Merkle tree data.**\n&nbsp; \nAs we can see, this custom serialization approach has several advantages:\n\n**1. Performance:** By directly copying the bytes of each element into a pre-allocated vector, we avoid the overhead of generic serialization libraries, resulting in faster serialization.\n\nTo quantify the performance benefits, let's consider an example scenario. Suppose we have a Merkle tree with 1,000,000 elements, where each element is a 32-byte hash. Using custom serialization, we can directly copy the bytes of each element into a pre-allocated vector, resulting in a serialized output size of exactly 32,000,000 bytes (32 MB). On the other hand, if we used a generic serialization library like borsh, there would be additional overhead. Borsh adds a 4-byte length prefix to the vector and may include other metadata. \n&nbsp; \n**Let's consider a typical NFT data structure to estimate overhead and analyze the potential overhead introduced by borsh serialization.**\n&nbsp; \nExample NFT Data Structure:\n\n```rust\nuse borsh::{BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize};\n\n#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize)]\npub struct NFT {\n    pub id: u64,\n    pub owner: String,\n    pub metadata: String,\n    pub approved_accounts: Vec<String>,\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the NFT struct contains the following fields:\n- id: a unique identifier of type u64.\n- owner: a string representing the owner of the NFT.\n- metadata: a string containing metadata associated with the NFT.\n- approved_accounts: a vector of strings representing the approved accounts for the NFT.\n\n&nbsp; \n### Borsh Serialization Overhead\n&nbsp; \nWhen serializing the NFT struct using borsh, the following overhead is introduced:\n\n**Field Type Information:**\n- id: Borsh uses 8 bytes to represent a u64 value.\n- owner and metadata: Borsh adds a 4-byte length prefix to each string to indicate the length of the string.\n- approved_accounts: Borsh adds a 4-byte length prefix to the vector to indicate the number of elements.\n\n**Field Values:**\n- id: The actual value of the id field is serialized as is, without additional overhead.\n- owner and metadata: The string contents are serialized after the length prefix.\n- approved_accounts: Each string in the vector is serialized with its 4-byte length prefix followed by the string contents.\n\n**Assuming the following values for the NFT struct:**\n- id: 42\n- owner: \"0x1234567890\" (12 bytes)\n- metadata: \"{ \"name\": \"Example NFT\", \"description\": \"This is an example NFT\" }\" (64 bytes)\n- approved_accounts: [\"0xabcdef1234\", \"0x9876543210\"] (2 elements, 12 bytes each)\n\n**The serialized output using borsh would consist of the following:**\n- id: 8 bytes\n- owner: 4 bytes (length prefix) + 12 bytes (string contents) = 16 bytes\n- metadata: 4 bytes (length prefix) + 64 bytes (string contents) = 68 bytes\n- approved_accounts: 4 bytes (length prefix) + 2 * (4 bytes (length prefix) + 12 bytes (string contents)) = 36 bytes\n\nThe total serialized size using borsh would be 8 + 16 + 68 + 36 = 128 bytes.\n&nbsp; \n### Custom Serialization\n&nbsp; \nIf we implement custom serialization for the NFT struct, we could reduce the overhead by eliminating the need for length prefixes and field type information. The custom serialization would only serialize the actual field values without additional metadata.\n\n**Using custom serialization, the serialized size would be:**\n- id: 8 bytes\n- owner: 12 bytes\n- metadata: 64 bytes\n- approved_accounts: 2 * 12 bytes = 24 bytes\n\nThe total serialized size using custom serialization is 8 + 12 + 64 + 24 = 108 bytes.\n&nbsp; \n**In this example, the overhead introduced by borsh serialization is approximately:**\n&nbsp; \n```\n(128 bytes - 108 bytes) / 108 bytes * 100% ≈ 18.5%\n```\n\nTherefore, custom serialization could reduce the serialized size by around 18.5% compared to borsh serialization for this specific NFT data structure.\n\nIt's important to note that the actual overhead may vary depending on the specific data structure, the size of the field values, and any additional optimizations the serialization library applies. The example is a simplified representation and may only reflect the exact overhead in some scenarios.\n\n**2. Simplicity:** The code is straightforward to understand, making it maintainable and less prone to bugs.\n\n**3. Control:** We have complete control over the serialization process, allowing us to optimize it for our specific use case and data structure.\n&nbsp; \n**However, it's important to note that custom serialization also comes with some trade-offs:**\n&nbsp; \n**1. Lack of flexibility:** The custom serialization method is tailored to the Merkle tree data structure and may not easily adapt to other data types or formats.\n\n**2. Maintenance:** As the codebase evolves, maintaining custom serialization logic across multiple components can become challenging and may lead to duplication of effort.\n\n**3. Interoperability:** Custom serialization formats may not be compatible with other systems or libraries, limiting interoperability.\n&nbsp; \n### A quick note about the Merkle Tree implementation\n&nbsp; \nThe contract showcases the dynamic nature of Merkle trees within smart contract operations. The `get_merkle_tree` method constructs a Merkle tree on-the-fly based on the contract's underlying data, while the `update_merkle_tree` and `update_merkle_tree_after_mint` methods play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of the Merkle tree.  Finally, by leveraging Merkle proofs, the contract can verify the inclusion of specific data elements within the Merkle tree without retrieving and processing the entire dataset. This optimization significantly reduces the computational overhead associated with data verification, enhancing the contract's performance and scalability. \n&nbsp; \n### Decisions…\n&nbsp; \nCustom serialization can provide a fast and efficient solution in scenarios where performance is critical, and the data structure is simple, like Merkle trees. However, a well-established serialization library like `borsch` and `serde` may be better for more complex data structures or when interoperability is a priority. Here are some ideas about when it is more convenient to opt for custom or standard serialization:\n&nbsp; \n### Custom Serialization\n&nbsp; \n- When building systems that require ultra-fast data processing, such as real-time trading platforms.\n- Minimizing binary size is crucial in embedded systems or IoT devices where resources are limited.\n- In security-sensitive applications, precise control over data handling is required to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.\n- When serialization and deserialization speed are critical, such as in high-frequency data logging applications.\n&nbsp; \n### Standard Serialization\n&nbsp; \n- In applications requiring support for multiple data formats and the ability to easily switch between them without significant code changes.\n- When developing software that must be interoperable with other systems that use standard serialization formats.\n- For projects that benefit from the community support, documentation, and updates established libraries like Serde and Borsch offer.\n- A robust error-handling mechanism is essential in complex systems with highly variable data structures.\n- When ease of use and reduced development time are prioritized over absolute performance optimization.\n&nbsp; \nUltimately, the decision depends on your project's specific requirements and constraints. By understanding the trade-offs and choosing the appropriate serialization approach, you can ensure that your Rust code is efficient, maintainable, and suited to your needs.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the article.

Led by top experts in the field, NEAR Foundation commits to incubating and investing in NEAR-based AI infrastructure projects. This includes compute and inference, data curation and rewarding creators, crowdsourcing, synthetic data marketplaces, agentic infrastructure, and more. Any AI application and novel consumer use case can leverage NEAR for the best User-Owned AI infrastructure and access everyone in Web3 via Chain Abstraction.\n\n[@near_ai](https://x.com/near_ai) AI R&D lab has been established , led by [@AlexSkidanov](https://x.com/AlexSkidanov)and , focusing on building an AI Developer to allow anyone to build end-to-end Web3 applications without code.\n\n**NEAR is the best place to build and incubate the next generation of AI projects.** NEAR Foundation, as a well-resourced not-for-profit with strong expertise in both AI and Web3, is positioned to drive a User-Owned AI movement that offers alternatives to closed, centralized players and succeeds at a global scale.\n\n2. **NEAR Smart Contract Versioning and Upgrades**:\n   - On NEAR, unlike EVM, you can overwrite the same contract address. End users can compile the contract and confirm the hash themselves. Once development stabilizes, you can remove all \"full access keys\" to make the contract immutable. Developers are discussing the process of versioning and upgrading smart contracts on the NEAR blockchain. \n   - Relevant link: [NEAR Rust SDK Contract Structure](https://docs.near.org/sdk/rust/contract-structure/nesting#error-prone-patterns)\n\n3. **Efficient Batch Transactions in NEAR**:\n   - Developers are exploring how to handle partial failures in batch transactions and the implications for transaction outcomes. When sending batch transactions, if one action fails, the entire transaction reverts. This is different from some blockchain systems where partial failures are allowed.\n   - Example code and error handling details are discussed in: [NEAR API JS Cookbook](https://github.com/near/near-api-js/blob/master/packages/cookbook/transactions/batch-transactions.js)\n\n4. **Updating NEAR Contracts Frequently**:\n   - Consider using a hook mechanism on another frequently called contract to trigger updates. Ensure efficient cross-contract calls for reliability.\n   - More information: [NEAR SDK](https://docs.near.org/docs/api/naj-quick-reference)\n\n5. **Managing Access Keys and Nonce Collisions**:\n   - Developers are exploring methods to handle nonce collisions when using multiple access keys in high-velocity transaction systems. This involves creating and managing access keys dynamically to avoid conflicts.\n\n6. **Implicit Accounts and Access Keys**:\n   - Implicit accounts can be managed like regular accounts post-creation, including adding and revoking access keys.\n   - Check out this discussion: [Twitter thread](https://x.com/ekuzyakov/status/1684786243232800768?s=46)\n\n7. **Cross-Contract Calls Best Practices**:\n   - Efficient implementation of cross-contract calls ensures reliability. Look into using promises and avoiding state confusion.\n\n8. **Integrating Wallet Connection Features**:\n    - Implementing wallet connection using near-wallet-selector. Ensure automatic linking of wallet information across devices.\n    - Helpful resource: [NEAR Wallet Selector GitHub](https://github.com/near/near-wallet-selector)\n\n9. **NEAR Contract State Management**:\n    -  Developers are sharing insights into effective state management in NEAR contracts, particularly focusing on Rust enums and macros to handle state migrations efficiently.\n    - Detailed guide: [NEAR Rust SDK Contract Structure](https://docs.near.org/sdk/rust/contract-structure/nesting#error-prone-patterns)\n\n10. **Token Metadata Updates in NEAR**:\n    - After updating token contracts, ensure the changes reflect correctly on explorers and wallets. This might require notifying indexers.\n\n11. **Testing NEAR Contracts with State Forking**:\n    - For context setting in tests, use integration testing libraries to copy the state of specific contracts.\n    - Testing library: [NEAR Workspaces RS](https://github.com/near/near-workspaces-rs)\n\n12. **Security in High-Velocity Systems**:\n    - Employ strategies like creating multiple full access keys to manage nonce collisions in high-velocity transaction systems.\n\n13. **Implicit Accounts Creation Constraints**:\n    - Implicit accounts can only bind the associated public key when created, ensuring security against unauthorized control.\n    - Example scenarios: (Chat excerpts on implicit account creation and security)\n\n14. **Pagoda**:\n    - Pagoda is going through a Privacy Assessment exercise with an external company. This officially kicked off last week and will be going until July. The goal is to help better support users with their privacy rights/needs but also identify and manage potential  privacy risks. We are following the NIST Privacy Framework in that respect.\n\n15. **Pagoda**:\n    - Pagoda is kicking off audits for Chain Signatures and the Multichain Gas Relayer. This is something that will be completed prior to the products launching on mainnet.\n  \n16. **UI Near Component Library Announcement**:\n\n Community member announced the availability of the UI Near component library, shared a link for feedback, and discussed Tailwind usage. The shared link was: [UI is Near](https://www.uiisnear.xyz/)\n\n17. **New Documentation feature:**\n\nCode Navigator was released on docs 🚨🎉, A new tool in docs that's able to better explain code-related concepts!

This release allows developers to leverage Roketo Business UI components in their projects and contribute to the toolkit's ongoing development.\n\n   - **Link**: [GitHub Repo - Roketo Business UI](https://github.com/roke-to/roketo-business-ui)\n\n15. **Discussion on Wallet Selector Dependency:**\n\nCommunity members discussed the need to update dependencies in the wallet selector tool to avoid hindering developer productivity. This discussion emphasized the importance of keeping tooling infrastructure up-to-date to support ongoing development efforts in the NEAR ecosystem.\n\n16. **Challenge with DelegateAction Export:**\n\nDevelopers encountered a challenge with exporting `DelegateAction` from the `near_primitives::transactions` module and discussed plans to address it.\n\n17. **Prompting for Missing CLI Command Arguments:**\n\nDevelopers discussed the idea of prompting users for missing CLI command arguments to enhance usability and streamline the command-line interface experience. This enhancement would improve user interaction with CLI commands and reduce the likelihood of errors due to missing arguments.\n\n18. **Introducing Cross shard congestion control**\n\nIn our recent Protocol Work Group call #10, we discussed and voted on NEP-522 and NEP-539. NEP-522, which proposed a solution to address nonce conflicts in NEAR transactions, was rejected as it did not pass the subject matter reviews.\n\nOn the other hand, NEP-539, which introduces a congestion control mechanism to manage increased network usage and congestion on specific shards, received strong support from all work group members and is leaning towards approval. Watch the recording [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1MOBmxKqhI). Join discussions [here](https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/539).\n\n19. **Proximity's Call for contributors**\n\nProximity is calling for contributors to help build a comprehensive library for constructing transactions across different chains. Learn how you can contribute [here](https://github.com/near/chainsig-lib).\n\n&nbsp; \n### THIS WEEKS TIPS 💡\n\n`Tip`: For key management in NEAR development, it's suggested to focus efforts on improving `cli-rs` instead of `cli-js`.\n\n`Tip`: When calling a contract using `near-api-js`, it's generally preferred to set up the account object (account.functionCall()) instead of the contract object (contract.method_name()), as the former is less confusing for developers.\n\n`Tip`: To ensure consistent and reproducible builds across computers, developers can use \"cargo near build\" which aims to link compiled wasm contracts with their code, enabling consistent builds.\n\n`Tip`: **New to NEAR? 👨‍💻 :** Whether you're familiar with Rust , JS, or simply eager to contribute to NEAR tooling, begin your journey with comprehensive NEAR docs and DevHub resources 👇:\n\n\n1.
